# Dinder

A basic Android App, built using Kotlin and Android Studio.



### How does it work?

You will see a photo of a dog displayed, along with some text outlining it's breed and it's personality.

Simply click on 'like' or 'dislike', and you will then be taken to the next image.

Continue doing this until you reach the end.

It will then take you back to the first image.
